#### Hello World !

Hello ! Welcome to my new blog. I had been thinking this for a long time to swtich my blog to Hugo. Hugo is a static website generator written in GoLang.
For this blog and my personal homepage I decided to write a custom theme.

I would be blogging about a lot of things, mostly focussing on Machine Learning, Python, Flask, Marathon Running.
